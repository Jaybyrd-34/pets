  <h1>My pets are ASSHOLES but I love them</h1>
  <h2>Here is why</h2>
  <p>I have three pets, a dog, a cat, and guinea pig. They 
    are all assholes to the furthest extreme. But i love them all. 
    Here I will break down their different chracteristics and personalities.
  </p>
  <p>We will start with my dog, Frank.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He is the laziest dog and will sleep all day if he could.</li>
    <li>He loves to eat, but only people food.</li> 
    <li>He has the scariest voice but its just a front.</li>
    <li>He also is the biggest bed hog.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now we move on to my cat, Luna</p>
  <ul>
    <li>She has the stinkiest poops of any animal.</li>
    <li>She loves to play chase.</li>
    <li>She is a profound excape artiest</li>
    <li>She is the sweetest</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Last but not least we have rosie</p>
  <ul>
    <li>She is an old sweet guinea pig</li>
    <li>She is a fatty and loves to eat.</li>
    <li>She is our first pet and likely the best</li>
  </ul>
